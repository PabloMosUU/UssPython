It uses the Pandas and NumPy libraries to analyze the dataset in the file `mcdonalds_menu.csv`, which provides a nutrition analysis of every menu item on the US McDonald's menu (including breakfast, beef burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches, fries, salads, soda, coffee and tea, milkshakes, and desserts). These data have been scraped from the McDonald's website. The assignment is basically about exploring how much fat and other nutrients contained in McDonald’s food. \n",

    "Background information: When it comes to fat, trans fats are really the ones to avoid. Trans fat is a byproduct of a process called hydrogenation that is used to turn healthy oils into solids and to prevent them from becoming rancid. It increases the amount of harmful LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. Cholesterol can be either good (HDL) or bad (LDL) but chances are slim that we are talking about the good one here. Saturated fat is not necessarily bad, but diet rich in saturated fat can drive up total cholesterol, with increased risk of clogged arteries. Unsaturated fat are not reported in this table.\n",

Merge the data frames `menu` and `grp_by_category` and create a mask to select the items that correspond to the maximal 'Total Fat (% Daily Value)'. Be careful, you may end up with more than one fattest item per category. Repeating the same process, extract now the fattest item in 'Trans fat' (make sure to select only items with Trans fat > 0). Sort them by decreasing order of Trans fat, display the resulting data frame.\n",
