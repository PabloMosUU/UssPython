    "\n",
    "First of all it is important to realize that we have worked with objects all the time, even though we were not so explicit about it until now. In Python anything used in a program is considered an object. Numbers, strings, complex data structures, functions, etc. They are all objects! In that sense, Python is a strongly object-oriented language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we have used functions and modules to organize our different pieces of functionality that manipulate data. This style of programming works fine for small- to medium-size data analysis applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing larger, more complex programs, however, it can be advantageous to follow an object-oriented programming style. Essentially, the idea is to work with application-specific data types to represent the relevant data. These types implement the corresponding functionality along with them rather than in stand-alone functions. This development style is also supported by Python."

    "*\t**Classes** are basically pieces of code that represent entities of a domain. For example, if our application domain is university lectures, we might have classes to represent courses, lectures, students, teachers, etc. And all these classes have certain properties and behavior. *Classes are templates for objects.*\n",
    "*\t**Objects** are *instances of classes*. That might sound abstract, but we have seen that many times before. For example, when we create an empty set ```s = set()```, technically we create an instance of class ```Set```, so we have a *set* object afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the university domain, a ```Student``` **class** could be used to represent students. An instance of the ```Student``` class would be an **object**, and it would represent a specific student.\n",

    "#### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "With the concept of inheritance, object-oriented programming offers another elegant way of reusing code. The idea is basically to establish and exploit a type-subtype relationship between classes. To give a real-world example: trees, flowers and vegetables are all plants. That is, they have things in common (e.g. they have roots and leaves, they grow) and things that are different (e.g. trees have trunks, flowers have blossoms, and vegetables can be used as food). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, plant is the *base type* or *base class*, and trees, flowers and vegetables are its *subtypes* or *subclasses*. Conversely, we can also say that plant is the *superclass* of the classes tree, flower and vegetable. Also, the latter might have further subclasses, for different kinds of trees, flowers, and vegetables. A class *inherits* the functions and variables of its superclass, that is, everything that holds for the superclass will also hold for the class itself. In terms of Python classes, it means that the variables and functions defined for a class will also be available for all of its subclasses, which might however define further functions and variables.\n",

A `Student` is a `Person` that in addition has a `university`, a study `program` and a number of `creditpoints`. The class `Student` also has a `printInfo` function, which displays information about the university and program in addition to the student’s name. With the functions `setCreditPoints` and `getCreditPoints` the credit points of the student can be set and retrieved. `BachelorStudent` and `MasterStudent` are subclasses of `Student`. Bachelor students have additional information about the place where they went to `school` before university. Master students have information about their Bachelor’s degree (variable `bdegree`).
