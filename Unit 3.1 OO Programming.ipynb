    "## Objects and Styles of Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all it is important to realize that we have worked with objects all the time, even though we were not so explicit about it until now. In Python anything used in a program is considered an object. Numbers, strings, complex data structures, functions, etc. They are all objects! In that sense, Python is a strongly object-oriented language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we have used functions and modules to organize our different pieces of functionality that manipulate data. This style of programming works fine for small- to medium-size data analysis applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing larger, more complex programs, however, it can be advantageous to follow an object-oriented programming style. Essentially, the idea is to define own, application-specific data types to represent the relevant data, and implement the corresponding functionality along with them rather than in stand-alone functions. This development style is also supported by Python."

    "## OOP Terminology\n",
    "Let’s introduce some terminology before we look at concrete examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\t**Classes** are basically pieces of code that represent entities of a domain. For example, if our application domain is university lectures, we might have classes to represent courses, lectures, students, teachers, etc. And all these classes have certain properties and behavior. *Classes are templates for objects.*\n",
    "*\t**Objects** are *instances of classes*. That might sound abstract, but we have seen that many times before. For example, when we create an empty set ```s = set()```, technically we create an instance of class ```Set```, so we have a set object afterwards.\n",
    "* **Fields** are variables that belong to a class or object.\n",
    "*  **Methods** are functions that belong to a class or object.\n",
    "*\t**Attributes** are fields and methods together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the university domain, a ```Student``` **class** could be used to represent students. An instance of the ```Student``` class would be an **object**, and it would represent a specific student. A student's name or ID would be stored as a **field**, and a function to list all of the courses a student is enrolled in would be a **method**.\n",
    "\n",

In the example above, we did not define an ```__init__``` method, so the default implementation was used, which creates a plain instance of the class. If we want to do something extra during instantiation, we can define an alternative ```__init__``` method; this is also called *overloading*. For example:"
