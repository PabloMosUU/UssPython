    "When copying lists, whether completely or partially with the slicing operators, it needs to be taken into account that copying of complex objects like lists behaves a bit differently than the copying of simple variable values. If the usual assignment operator (=) is used, only the reference to the list is copied, meaning that all changes to the original list are also visible in the copied list, because they refer to the same object. When using the slicing operator or a dedicated `copy()` function, the (respective) elements of the list are copied into a new object that is independent from the original. This is sometimes also called a \"shallow copy\". If the list contains a reference to another list or complex object, however, only the reference will be copied. Therefore, in this case \"deep copy\" needs to be made in order to copy the whole list completely. The following code illustrates the difference:"
