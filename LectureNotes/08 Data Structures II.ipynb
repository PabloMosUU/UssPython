However, the printouts after the function calls show a difference: The string is still the same as before the manipulation, while the dictionary has changed. The reason for this lies in the way that parameters are passed to functions. Passing variables of the basic data types (such as strings, integers, floats and booleans) happens as call-by-value, that is, the current value of the variable is copied to create a new local variable with the same value for use inside the function. Because it is only visible in the scope of the function, however, changes to it will not be visible after the function. To achieve that, the new values would have to be returned by the function and, e.g., assigned to another variable by the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, passing variables of complex data types (such as lists and dictionaries) happens as call-by-reference. As with shallow copies, only the reference to the (address of the) object in the memory is copied to a new variable and passed as argument, but no (deep) copy of the object itself is created. Thus, manipulations to the object that happen inside a function will also be visible afterwards, also without returning and re-assigning the result of the function. If a function is not supposed to be able to change the object passed as an argument, a (deep) copy needs to be made before it is passed to the function."

    "### 3. Room Occupancy (★★★★☆)\n",
    "Imagine a small hostel with four four-bed rooms (with the arbitrarily chosen numbers 101, 102, 201, and 202). You want to write a little program for the hostel staff to help them keep track of the room occupancy and checking guests in and out. The code for the user interaction already exists (see below), but you still need to implement the missing functions:\n",
    "* `print_occupancy` should simply print out a list of all rooms and the guests that are currently checked in.\n",
    "* `check_in` should add a guest to a room. If a non-existing room number is given or if the chosen room is already full, a corresponding message should be printed. It is allowed to have two (or more) guests with the same name in one room. \n",
    "* `check_out` should remove a guest from a room. If a wrong room number or guest name is passed, a corresponding message should be printed. \n",
