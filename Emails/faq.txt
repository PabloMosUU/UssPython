TOPIC: WILL LECTURES BE RECORDED?

The lectures will not be recorded, because they are interactive so they cannot be faithfully reproduced in a recording. 

TOPIC: WILL THE LECTURES BE HYBRID?

They will not be hybrid, as hybrid lectures make it more difficult for the teacher to focus on what is happening in the classroom.

TOPIC: I WANT TO SIGN OFF THE COURSE BUT I CAN'T

EN: For enrollment-related questions, please contact your faculty student desk (studiepunt).
NL: Voor het uitschrijven kun je terecht bij het studiepunt van je faculteit.

TOPIC: IS ATTENDANCE MANDATORY?

Attendance at lectures and seminar is highly encouraged, as both are interactive and missing them can hurt your chances at learning the subject matter. However, we do not strictly require attendance.

TOPIC: I CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE EXAM. CAN I MAKE IT UP ON ANOTHER DATE?

Unfortunately, we cannot make individual examination instances. You are allowed to miss at most 1 examination (midterm, project, or final) in the course, and you can retake it at the official retake date on 5th July from 5 to 8 PM.

TOPIC: ANY QUESTION RELATED TO A LECTURE YOU ARE NOT TEACHING

This lecture is not taught by me. You can find the lecturer for each lecture on the course manual, which is on Blackboard.

TOPIC: ONE OF THE STUDENTS IN THE GROUP IS NOT RESPONDING

Please do the project as if this person were not in the group, and write in your report, where you discuss the division of tasks, that this student did not respond to your emails and did not participate in the project. You will be graded as though this person were not in the group.

TOPIC: ANY QUESTION RELATED TO SEMINARS

Please direct all seminar-related questions to Eduardo Calo, who is the seminar coordinator.
